🚀 **My Coding Journey Update: Day 1-21 of the 180-Day Code Challenge!** 🚀

🌟 *As it's my first post on my profile, I'm excited to share my progress in the 180-Day Code Challenge with Rohit Negi!* 🌟

Hey GitHub fam! 👋

👉 **Days 1-3: The Foundations**
From unraveling the history of humans to grasping the intricacies of the Egypt number system, I've embarked on a journey into coding. Exploring transistors, binary numbers, and various counting methods, each day has been a revelation. Day 2 focused on mastering flowcharts and pseudocode, setting the stage for elegant solutions.

🖥️ **Day 3: "Start C++ from Zero"**
In Lecture 3, Rohit Negi guided me through C++ basics—writing my first program, understanding variables and data types—a thrilling introduction to the world of programming!

💡 **Days 5-9: Advancing Skills**
Advanced for-loops, prime numbers, Fibonacci series—the challenges keep coming, enhancing both my coding and problem-solving skills. Day 8 explored star patterns, refining my coding techniques.

🔥 **Days 10-11: Intermediate and Advanced Patterns**
Tackling intermediate and advanced-level pattern problems, from numbers to pyramids, these days have been about pushing boundaries and honing my coding craft.

📈 **Day 12: Mastering Operators**
From arithmetic to bitwise, mastering operators has added a new layer to my programming proficiency.

👀 **Days 13-14: Revise and Reinforce**
Taking a step back to revise and reinforce the knowledge gained so far. Crucial for a solid foundation!

🚀 **Days 15-20: Boosting Coding Skills**
Ready to boost my coding skills further, I'm actively engaged in ongoing DSA series sessions. This series is designed to master fundamental data structures and algorithms—a must-have skill for every aspiring programmer. By participating, you'll gain a solid foundation, improve problem-solving abilities, and enhance job prospects in the tech industry.

👀 **In recent sessions, I've learned:**
- Example with for loops
- All types of looping
- Switch case, break statement, continue
- Binary numbers, binary to decimal, decimal to binary
- LeetCode problem-solving
- Functions and problem-solving using functions

👉 **Day 20-21: Revision Time**
A period for reflection and reinforcing concepts learned. Ready for the challenges ahead!

Huge thanks to Rohit Negi for being an incredible mentor, and to the hashtag#CoderArmy community for the continuous support. Excited to continue this coding journey!
